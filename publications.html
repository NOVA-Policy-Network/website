            Legal framework addressing cognitive enhancement in environments with implicit pressure, such as competitive schools or elite work sectors, where formal coercion may be absent but social pressure creates de facto requirements. This law recognizes that coercion can be subtle and systemic rather than explicit. The framework establishes criteria for identifying coercive environments, creates protection mechanisms for individuals choosing not to enhance, and develops institutional accountability standards while establishing safe harbor provisions for legitimate competitive contexts.
